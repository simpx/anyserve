# Multi-Stage Pipeline Example

> Work in progress - example coming soon

This example will demonstrate how to build multi-stage inference pipelines with AnyServe, where the output of one model becomes the input to another model.

## Planned Features

- Sequential model chaining
- Parallel model execution
- Result aggregation
- Pipeline error handling

## Usage (Coming Soon)

```bash
python examples/multi_stage/run_example.py
```
